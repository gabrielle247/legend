# Ledger Separation Plan (Reminder)

Goal: Split ledger usage into:

- Global ledger (all school-wide financial activity)
- Student ledger (student-centric transactions only)
- School finances ledger (non-student income/expenses)

Notes

- Implement later: database schema changes, migrations, and repository updates.
- Keep current flows intact for now; only plan the separation.
